# Severe mental illness and receipt of acute cardiac care following myocardial infarction

## Project description

Severe mental illness (SMI), which includes schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depression, affects about one in ten people. People with SMI die 10-20 years sooner than people without SMI (Ajetunmobi, Taylor et al. 2013, Hjorthoj, Sturup et al. 2017). This is mainly due to poorer physical health, in particular a higher risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), including myocardial infarction (MI) (Ajetunmobi, Taylor et al. 2013, Correll, Solmi et al. 2017).

After an MI, people with SMI are more likely to die than those without SMI (Chan, Chu et al. 2022). The reasons for this are not well understood, but they are likely to be multifactorial, with systemic disparities in diagnosis, clinical investigation and treatment in primary and secondary care settings thought to be an important contributory factor (Firth, Siddiqi et al. 2019). With respect to management of MI in the early post-event period, receipt of coronary revascularisation has been most studied, with lower rates observed in those with SMI (Schulman-Marcus, Goyal et al. 2016, Shao, Zhuo et al. 2020, Fleetwood, Wild et al. 2021). However, detailed understanding of how and why acute care for MI differs by SMI status and the contribution of this to short-term post-MI mortality is lacking. Furthermore, we do not know whether any differences in delivery of care and risk of dying after an MI have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. It is important to investigate this, to inform responses to this now and in future situations where disruptions of care occur.

This [protocol](https://github.com/BHFDSC/CCU046_01/tree/main/protocol) describes the methods we will use to examine SMI and receipt of acute cardiac care following myocardial infarction. A second protocol will describe our methods for examining severe mental illness and mortality following MI.
