# Severe mental illness and receipt of acute cardiac care following myocardial infarction

## Project description

Severe mental illness (SMI), which includes schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depression, affects about one in ten people. People with SMI die 10-20 years sooner than people without SMI (Fleetwood et al. 2025, Hjorthoj et al. 2017). This is mainly due to poorer physical health, in particular a higher risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), including myocardial infarction (MI) (Ajetunmobi et al. 2013, Correll et al. 2017).

After an MI, people with SMI are more likely to die than those without SMI (Chan et al. 2022). The reasons for this are not well understood, but they are likely to be multifactorial, with systemic disparities in diagnosis, clinical investigation and treatment in primary and secondary care settings thought to be an important contributory factor (Firth et al. 2019). With respect to management of MI in the early post-event period, receipt of coronary revascularisation has been most studied, with lower rates observed in those with SMI (Schulman-Marcus et al. 2016, Shao et al. 2020, Fleetwood et al. 2021). However, detailed understanding of how and why acute care for MI differs by SMI status is lacking. Furthermore, we do not know whether any differences in delivery of care after an MI have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. It is important to investigate this, to inform responses to this now and in future situations where disruptions of care occur.

This [protocol](https://github.com/BHFDSC/CCU046_01/tree/main/protocol) describes the methods used to examine SMI and receipt of acute cardiac care following myocardial infarction.
