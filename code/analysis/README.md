The top level script 01_prepare_data.R prepares the data for both the NSTEMI and STEMI cohorts and should be run first. There is a folder for each type of myocardial infaraction (nstemi and stemi), a folder for the code that creates the publication figures (figures) and a folder for additional helper functions (r). Within each folder, where scripts are numbered, they should be run in numerical order.
