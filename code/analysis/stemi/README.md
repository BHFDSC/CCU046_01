# Analysis code for the STEMI cohort

03_care_describe_STEMI.Rmd creates the descriptive tables and figures.

The remainder of the scripts run the mixed effects logistic regression models. There is one pair of scripts for each outcome and within each pair of scripts, (a) runs the main analysis and (b) runs the sensitivity analysis. The number at the start of each file name corresponds to the outcome as follows:

20. call-to-balloon within 120 mins
21. call-to-balloon within 150 mins
22. door-to-balloon within 60 mins
23. door-to-balloon within 90 mins
24. referral for cardiac rehabilitation
25. receipt of all indicated secondary prevention medication
