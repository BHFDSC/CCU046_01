# Analysis code for the NSTEMI cohort

02_care_describe_NSTEMI.Rmd creates the descriptive tables and figures.

The remainder of the scripts run the mixed effects logistic regression models. There is one pair of scripts for each outcome and within each pair of scripts, (a) runs the main analysis and (b) runs the sensitivity analysis. The numbers at the start of each script correspond to the outcome as follows:

10. angiography eligility
11. angiography receipt
12. angiography within 72 hours
13. cardiac ward admission
14. referral for cardiac rehabilitation
15. receipt of all indicated secondary prevention medication
